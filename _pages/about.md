I am a second year Master student from the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Dr. [John Galeotti](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-galeotti/) in [Biomedical Image Guidance Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/biomedical-image-guidance/). My research topics are about ultrasound image analysis and ultrasound guidance for needle steering. I am interested in the real-time ultrasound image segmentation and/or localization, and better control with image guidance in robot-assisted surgery.
I will join the University of British Columbia as a Ph.D. student in September 2021!

I received my B.S. degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. I was advised by Professor [Qining Wang](http://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891217.htm) from 2017 to 2019, and I visited [Biomechatronics Lab](https://uclabiomechatronics.wordpress.com/) at University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Professor [Veronica J. Santos](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/veronica-santos/), for [the Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology (CSST)](https://csst.ucla.edu/)  program in 2018.
